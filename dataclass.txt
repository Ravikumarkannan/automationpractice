What is Data class:
A data class is a regular Python class deal specifically with the data and its representation.


why we need to go for data class
we don't have to write code to get proper initialization, representation, and comparisons for objects
data class implementing following methods
 __init__ --> instantiate variables
 __repr__ --> string representation of an object  class name(variables=value)
 __eq__   -->   Both instances in the comparison identical type
 
By default Data Classes will add the __init__() and __repr__() to user-defined classes

How to implement Data class
using @dataclass decorator
syntax --> variable name: type

Adding default values to dataclass

number: int = 10

Frozen instances
@dataclass(frozen=True) -->immutable Python objects
@dataclass(frozen=False) -->mutable Python objects


Type Hints
variable: type -->type hint is mandatory
name:str 

marks:Any  -->if you do not want to add explicit types to your data class, use typing.Any:

Inheritance
To use base class fiels in sub class

if a field in a base class has a default value, then all new fields added in a subclass must have default values as well.

Optimizing Data Classes
used to make classes faster and use less memory
data classes use something called a default_factory to handle mutable default values.
field() specifier is used to customize each field of a data class individually




lat: float = field(default=0.0, repr=False).
